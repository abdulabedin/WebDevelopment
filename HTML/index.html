    <pre>
    I am currently a second-year Computer Science Co-op student at Ryerson. I am looking to apply my technical knowledge
    to help solve real-world problems and impact billions around the world.
    
    My passions include Full Stack Development,Android Development, Cybersecurity, Blockchain, and Artificial Intelligence.
    
    This past summer I had the opportunity to work as a research assistant under professor Sadaf Mustafiz. I worked on designing
    a Smart Fire alarm System with commercial and residential applications. Through my work, I was able to improve my knowledge 
    of the Software Development Lifecycle especially requirements elicitation and requirements analysis. I also learned about 
    model-driven engineering and how to generate use cases using various methods. Overall, this opportunity has helped further
    my interest in Software Engineering and I look forward to continuing my journey in this field.
    
    I look forward to connecting with all of you!
